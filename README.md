### About
Restaurant application created by team MSG for CSE110 UCSD Spring Quarter 2104.  The app contains two components,
the iOS app which has the source including here, and the website which can be found at http://menyouapp.com
The website component is not regularly updated here as we edit it on the server instead of uploading here.

### Use
The app is designed to be used and tested for the iPhone5/5s running iOS 7.1.1 or later.  The website is compatible
with Safari vesrion 7.0.4 with javascript enabled and is best displayed at a window size of 1259 x 897.
The phone must also have a network connection and the app must be allowed to access location.  Furthermore, some
features required the phone to have a camera.
