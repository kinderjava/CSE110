### About
Restaurant application created by team MSG for CSE110 UCSD Spring Quarter 2104.  The app contains two components,
the iOS app which has the source included here, and the website which can be found at http://menyouapp.com
The website component is not regularly updated here as we edit it on the server instead of uploading here.

This app was created with a simple goal in mind, simplify the experience of ordering at restaurants.
Using menu, all your favorite restaurant menus are just one click away.  You can add items to your order and even
use the app to place your order.  Menyou even remembers your dietary preferences and will filter out items you don't
want to see.  Menyou shows you the most popular items on a menu and even lets you swipe away items you don't want,
letting you narrow down your choice to the perfect order.

### Use
The app is designed to be used and tested for the iPhone5/5s running iOS 7.1.1 or later.  The website is best viewed
with Safari vesrion 7.0.4 and requires javascript enabled; it is best displayed at a window size of 1259 x 897.
The phone must also have a network connection and the app must be allowed to access location.  Furthermore, some
features require the phone to have a camera.

### Building
The app has been updated to support iOS 8 and is still backrwards compatible with iOS 7 but must be compiled with Xcode 6 Beta 1.  If you do not have the latest Xcode, you can still compile the app with Xcode 5 if you comment out two sections that use iOS 8 APIs.
